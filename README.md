This Python scripts provides basic tools to generate 
1. simulated Raman spectra of basic cell compartments and
2. simulated Raman spectra of plasma samples of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.

The code allows for varying levels of noise, fluorescence, cosmic ray spikes, and the addition and removal of Raman signals, as well as changing the shapes.
